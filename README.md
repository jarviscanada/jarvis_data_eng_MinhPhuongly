## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MinhPhuongly.git](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MinhPhuongly.git)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MinhPhuongly.git/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MinhPhuongly/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Implemented a cluster monitoring system which helps to automatically collect hardware specifications from Centos servers every minutes using Crontab and Bash scripts. The data then will be stored in PostgresSQL database provisioned using Docker for later querying to answering some business questions such as the amount of memory used of each server within 5 minutes interval and detect server failures. The PostgresSQL container is also can be start/stop/create by a bash script. We used Git as a version control system to manage the code and followed GitFlow branching strategy.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MinhPhuongly.git/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: Curabitur laoreet tristique leo, eget suscipit nisi. Sed in sodales ex. Maecenas vitae tincidunt dui, et eleifend quam.
  - JDBC App: Curabitur laoreet tristique leo, eget suscipit nisi. Sed in sodales ex. Maecenas vitae tincidunt dui, et eleifend quam.
  - Grep App: Curabitur laoreet tristique leo, eget suscipit nisi. Sed in sodales ex. Maecenas vitae tincidunt dui, et eleifend quam.

## Highlighted Projects
**Fetching RESTAPIs App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/minhphuong1994/fetch_API_flask.git)]: Built APIs to manipulate another API and return processed JSON data. To improve the performance, Thread was used to make asynchronous requests. Additionally, server-side cache was implemented with Requests-cache to diminish the cost of API requests.

**Travel Booking Android App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/minhphuong1994/TravelAgent_AndroidApp)]: Showed tourist points on ListView. Users' selected tour was saved to SharedPreferences and used Intent to change screen. SQLite was used for data persistence. Booked tours details were then calculated and displayed on another screen.


## Professional Experiences

**Data Engineer, Jarvis (2021-present)**: Worked in a Data Engineer team that followed the Agile/Scrum model to implement multiple projects in Linux/Bash, Java, Docker and SQL. Conducted daily scrum meetings and bi weekly sprint meetings with the team to keep on track with everyone's work.

**Full-stack Web Developer (part-time), ASA Energy Consulting Ltd. (2020-present)**: Implemented from scratch a web application using Flask framework for users to generate reports from multiple collected data sources based on user's requirements. The front-end was implemented with the help of HTML5, JavaScript ES6, Bootstrap and Jinja and JQuery. The app used DynamoDB as a database and S3 as a file server. There was a C++ application which was built to collaborate with the web server to perform complicated and heavy calculations for generating reports. The reports were also projected into charts on the web interface using ChartJs. The web app was hosted on EC2 with HTTPS using NginX,WSGI and DNS service.

The data then will be stored in PostgresSQL database provisioned using Docker for later querying to answer some business questions such as the amount of memory used of each server within 5 minutes interval and detect server failures. The PostgresSQL container also can be controlled by a bash script. We used Git as a version control system to manage the code and followed GitFlow branching strategy.",

The app can handle oversized files thanks to the help of Stream API. It was tested manually and then packaged into an uber jar file using Maven. The file was then used to create a Docker image and published to Docker Hub.",

Spring was used to replace the legacy main method and build an uber jar file with Maven. The file was then tested manually to make a Docker image. The image was published to DockerHub for easier sharing."

There was a C++ application that was built to collaborate with the web server to perform complicated and heavy calculations for generating reports. The reports were also projected into charts on the web interface using ChartJs. The web app was hosted on EC2 with HTTPS using NginX, WSGI and DNS service.",

  "summary": "Being impassioned in exploring and experiencing new technologies, I got my bachelor's degree in Communication and Computer Network and have one year of experience as an IT Operation Specialist at ILA English Language Center. With the desire to explore something more challenging, I decided to take a Computer Software and Database Development program in Canada. During school, I had a chance to be part of the school's student research team and then had a Co-op term as a full-stack web developer at ASA Energy Consulting.  \nAfter graduating, I have joined Jarvis and since then, collaborating with team members in an Agile/Scrum environment is now comfortable to me. Besides, I have acquired precious knowledge by working on many projects using valuable technologies such as Linux/Bash, PostgresSQL, Docker, Maven, etc. I now have knowledge and experience in operating systems, computer networking, and software programming. Applying my knowledge to solve real-world problems is what inspires me so far."

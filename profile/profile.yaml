# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: "Being impassioned in exploring and experiencing new technologies,
I got my bachelor degree in Communication and Computer Network and experienced roughly 1 year as an IT Operation
Specialist at ILA English Language Center in Vietnam. Because of the job's characteristics,
I got bored of daily repeated tasks and have decided to pursue a software development career.
After completed a 2 years post-graduate program called Computer Software and Database Development
in Canada with some Co-op and part-time experience as a full-stack web developer.
I now have knowledge and experience in operating systems, computer networking and software programming.
Continuously challenging things, improving and collecting technology knowledge is my favorite so far."

    description: "Implemented a cluster monitoring system which helps to automatically collect hardware specifications
    from Centos servers every minute using Crontab and Bash scripts. The data then will be stored in PostgresSQL
    database provisioned using Docker for later querying to answering some business questions such as the amount of
    memory used of each server within 5 minutes interval and detect server failures. The PostgresSQL container
    also can be controlled by a bash script. We used Git as a version control system to manage the code and followed GitFlow branching strategy."

      - "Grep App: a Java application that implements the use of grep command in Linux. It scans recursively files in a directory and then return a sequence of strings that match the input pattern. The app can handle over-sized files thanks to the help of Stream API. It was tested manually and then packaged into an uber jar file using Maven. The file was then used to create docker image and published to Docker Hub."
      - "JDBC App: a Java app that applied DAO pattern in using JDBC to create CRUD functions working with a dockerized Postgres Database. The project used Maven to manage the dependencies and IntelliJ for developing and testing."

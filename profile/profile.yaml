    description: "Implemented a cluster monitoring system which helps to automatically collect hardware specifications
    from Centos servers every minutes using Crontab and Bash scripts. The data then will be stored in PostgresSQL
    database provisioned using Docker for later querying to answering some business questions such as the amount of
    memory used of each server within 5 minutes interval and detect server failures. The PostgresSQL container is
    also can be start/stop/create by a bash script. We used Git as a version control system to manage the code and followed GitFlow branching strategy."
